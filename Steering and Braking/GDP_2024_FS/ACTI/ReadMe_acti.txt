                    recording rates for the two groups can be specified through the acti.exe
                    settings menu. Note that the recording rates should not exceed the average video
                    frame rate.

                    log

                - added new data channels (i.e. extra KERS settings / parameters, brake & tire tread
                    temps and a few other misc channels)
                - updated sample Motec i2 project to display the new data channels
                - updated sample ACTI Live Telem workspace to display the new data channels

// Notes:
        - ACTI records telemetry data at a rate of 20 Hz (by default) and displays it live at a rate of 2 Hz

// Known Issues:
        - If acti.exe is launched from in-game and you fully exit Assetto Corsa with acti.exe DISCONNECTED,
            you will need to manually close acti.exe before you can start Assetto Corsa again (Steam will
            report that "the app is still running"
        - In hotlap / race sessions, the FIRST timed lap recorded by ACTI (as viewed in Motec's i2) may
            show a slightly different laptime compared to what Assetto Corsa officially recorded. The
            difference should be less than the ACTI sampling period (i.e. <50ms).
        - If the in-game ACTI Trigger Control is unable to launch ACTI due to a "Unicode Decode Error",
            you need to manually specify the system text encoding. You can do this by opening a command
            prompt, typing in "chcp" [Enter] and writing the provided value in the ACTI Trigger Control
            config.ini next to "text_encoding_override" (the number value should be preceded by "cp").
