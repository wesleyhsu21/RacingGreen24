# Lap_Time_Sim_OOP

OOP lap time sim. I will add comments to the new files shortly!

In the latest version, I added a GUI and a new tire function to find slip angle and ratio. In addition, I added an AWD drive mode.

Fixes:

-Fixed Motor force being 0 on straight due to high RPMS

Things to address:

-Runtime (People from computing should help here)
-Report Generation (20% Done)
-Aero Maps (SEM will do it)
